    <h2>Objective</h2>
    <p>
        The goal of the game is to win all the cards by defeating your opponent in head-to-head battles.
    </p>

    <h2>Setup</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The deck consists of 52 randomly selected cards. This means the entire deck could potentially contain only Ace of Spades or any other combination of cards.</li>
        <li>Each player is dealt half of the deck (26 cards each).</li>
        <li>Players do not look at their cards; instead, they draw from the top of their deck during each round.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Gameplay</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Both players reveal the top card of their deck at the same time.</li>
        <li>The player with the higher card wins both cards and places them at the bottom of their deck.</li>
        <li>If the cards are equal in value (a tie), the tied cards are set aside, and another round is played.</li>
        <li>The winner of the next round takes all the previously tied cards along with the cards from the new round.</li>
        <li>The game continues until one player has all 52 cards.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Card Values</h2>
    <p>Cards rank in the following order (lowest to highest):</p>
    <p>2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King, Ace</p>

    <h2>Winning the Game</h2>
    <p>
        The game ends when one player has collected all 52 cards. That player is declared the winner!
    </p>

    <h2>Additional Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>If the game reaches a state where both players continuously tie without resolving, a draw may be declared.</li>
        <li>Luck plays a major role due to the randomized deck composition.</li>
    </ul>
